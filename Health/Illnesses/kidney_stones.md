[Who Knew Preventing Kidney Stones Was this Easy?, by Dr. Mercola](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/06/23/who-knew-preventing-kidney-stones-was-this-easy.aspx). Quotes:
* The number one risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough water. Waiting until you feel thirsty is often too late. Thirst usually signifies dehydration.
    * How do you know if you are drinking enough water? Your urine should be a light yellow. 
* Another risks: being sedentary, high blood pressure, digestive problems, a diet high in sugar, drinking soda, diets high in processed salt, consumption of non-fermented soy.
* Avoid drinking tea since it is high in oxalates.
* Prevention:
    * stay well hydrated
    * avoid taking prescription drugs that harm more than they heal
    * avoid sugar, soy, caffeine, excess salt, and processed foods
    * get plenty of exercise to keep your body’s fluids moving
    * make sure you’re getting adequate magnesium and vitamin B6 in your diet, which have both been suggested to help prevent kidney stone formation
