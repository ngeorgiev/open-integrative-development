## 4 Mantras in Relationships

[The 4 Mantras by Thich Nhat Hahn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEUxFNkISnU):

* **Darling, I am here for you.**
    * when you love someone, the best thing you can offer him or her is your presence.
* **Darling, I know you are there and I am so happy.**
    * to be loved means to be recognized as existing.
* **Darling, I know you suffer, that's why I am here for you.** *(when your beloved one suffers)*
    * before you do something to help him or her, your presence can already bring some relief.
* **Darling, I suffer. I am trying my best to practice. Please help me.** *(when you suffer because of your beloved one)*
