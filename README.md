Open Holistic Development
============================

## Vision

### Introduction

**Holistic Development** means that we develop ourselves, not in one or few areas, but we learn about, live and spread the best of every area of life. **Open** means that the development is shared and free for everyone to create, improve, spread, participate, etc, virtually and phyisically.

### Areas of Life

We develop personally and collectively in all important and beneficial areas of live. Here are few examples:

* Being, Awareness, Love, Acceptance, Heart, Intuition
* Integrity, Transparency
* Freedom, Sharing, Giving, Receiving
* Ethics, Human Dignity, Solidarity, Social Justice
* Interconnectedness, System Thinking
* Personal Development
* Communication, Relationships
* Health Development, Nutrition
* Ecology, Permaculture, Biology, Mathematics, Physics
* Technology, Computer Science, Design
* Economy, Money
* Entrepreneurship, Organizations
* Community, Group processes, Decision making
* Music, Pratical Skills
* ...

## What and How

We look at the totality of Life, ask ourselves what we love and what we are curious about, and dive into it. We learn it, do it and share it with other people.

### Meetings

We create open learning groups where everyone can participate and we can develop together. We create public events where we share what we have learned with others. You can:

* Join a learning group or event:
    * [Berlin, Germany](Berlin.md)
* Start a learning group or event in your local area.

If there is the desire from other people we can hold also virtual (e.g. Google Hangouts) meetups.

### Creating and Sharing

We save all our research and all important learnings in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment). We do our best to communicate our learnings by simple, understandable and easily memorable:

* A4 printable sheets - to be printed and posted at home, work, public spaces, etc.
* infographics - to be shared online
* actions for every area of life, we can do to improve.
* articles, videos and pictures
* music, dances - for the body and senses

You can:

* [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/) and start [creating and improving the files](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment).
* [ask and answer any questions in the GitHub issues](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment/issues).
* [fork](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment) or [download the repository](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment/archive/master.zip), and use it as you wish.


## Principles

* Big Picture Communication. Every idea can be:
    * described in one sentence, in one paragraph,
    * in a picture (e.g. before/after or big picture)
    * linked to further explanation/details.
* Easy to understand, share, do and develop
* System understanding, communication and teaching/sharing
* Connected to real life as much as possible
* applicable throughout time (every day and after dozens of years)
* Inspiration
* Open Source


## Translations

We aim to translate the most inspiring and valuable informations in other language. Feel free to chose what you like and translate it.


## Use

## Create a folder

* Create a new file or edit a file
* Enter in the file name your desired directory name with a forward slash at the end, like ``DirectoryName/``, and then the file name. On save, GitHub will automatically create the directory ``DirectoryName/`` containing a file with the given file name.
