Open Holistic Development
============================

## Vision

### Introduction

**Holistic Development** means that we develop ourselves, not in one or few areas, but we learn about, live and spread the best of every area of life. **Open** means that the development is shared and free for everyone to create, improve, spread, participate, etc, virtually and phyisically.

### Areas of Life

We develop personally and collectively in all important and beneficial areas of live. Here are few examples:


* Being, Awareness, Love, Acceptance, Heart, Intuition
* Integrity, Transparency
* Freedom, Sharing, Giving, Receiving
* Ethics, Human Dignity, Solidarity, Social Justice
* Interconnectedness, System Thinking
* Personal Development
* Communication, Relationships
* Health Development, Nutrition
* Ecology, Permaculture, Biology, Mathematics, Physics
* Technology, Computer Science, Design
* Economy, Money
* Entrepreneurship, Organizations
* Community, Group processes, Decision Making
* Music, Pratical Skills
* ...

## What and How

We look at the totality of Life, ask ourselves what we love and what we are curious about, and dive into it.

* learn
* do
* share

We save all our research and all important learnings in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment). We do our best to communicate our learnings by simple, understandable and easily memorable:

* A4 printable sheets - to be printed and posted at home and work
* infographics - to be shared online
* articles, videos and pictures
* music, dances - for the body and senses
* actions for every area of life, that we can do to improve.

We create open learning groups where everyone can be and participate. We create public events where we share what we have learned with others.



You can:

* [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/) and start [creating and improving the files](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment).
* [ask and answer any questions in the GitHub issues](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment/issues).
* [fork the repository](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment) and use it as you wish.
* [download the repository](https://github.com/openholisticdevelopment/openholisticdevelopment/archive/master.zip)


We plan to share and learn together also virtually (through Google+ or newer open source technologies). Soon you can find more infos about the virtual meetings here.


### Meetings

We organize open meetings where we learn together. You can:

* Start a meeting in your local area.
* Join a meeting.


## Process

### The Big Picture

* Research - open, life-long, experiental
* Personal and Societal development, see the Topics
* Actions for every topic / area of life.
* Source the best (big picture/best practices) literature and examples
    * ask people what their favorite books are, what influenced them profoundly.
    * ask experts.
    * check Timm Ferris' way of learning and asking questions.
    * ...

### Quality Questions

* If you die tomorrow, what will you share to humanity?
* What are the topics that everyone on Earth should know about?
* ...

### Outputs
Possible outputs:

* I know and understand what are the best development possibilities in every area of life and know what actions I can undertake to improve.
* book for audults, teens, kids

## Topics


## Principles

* Big Picture Communication:
    * Every idea can be described in one sentence, in one paragraph, in a picture (e.g. before/after or big picture), linked to further explanation/details.
* Easy to understand, share, do and develop
* Systemic communication and teaching/sharing
* Connected to real life as much as possible
* applicable throughout time (every day and after dozens of years)
* Open Source


## Desired Outcomes

* provide the big picture with the "best practices"
* system understanding
* inspire
* provde concrete steps people can take now to improve in every area
* a book I can give to my neighbor, brother, mother and father.
* living acions are most important. How to create and spread them?
