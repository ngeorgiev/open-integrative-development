We start forming learning groups in Berlin.


## Learning Groups

We are just starting the learning groups are still be formed. Few possible learning groups could be:

* **Love, Heart, Intuition, Acceptance, Being (Jan)** (current)
* System Thinking, Nutrition (Feb)
* Economy (March)
* Open Organizations and Entrepreneurship (April)


## Weekly Rhythm

Suggested weekly rhythm:

* Monday-Thursday: one/two meetups
* Friday night - get together, learn and practice
* Satuday, Sunday - get together, learn and practice

## For Free

The meetups are organized from the heart of everyone of us for free. There are no money strings attached to the meetups. Nobody receives money for organizing them and donations are not requested.

Every meetup exists because of the pure intrinsic desire to learn, share and give.

## Freedom

Everyone coming can co-decide how we organize the meetings. If few people want to explore particular topics, they are free to share the intention in the group, get the whole group together or form a subgroup and do it. We are experimenting and want to have as open and as heartful atmosphere as possible.

Sometimes the topic and way of organizing the group will be defined before the meetup.
