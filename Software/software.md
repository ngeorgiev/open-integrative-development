# Ownership

* [The Pull Request Hack](http://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html) by Felix Geisend√∂rfer:
    * Once people have commit access, they are no longer worried that their patch might go unmerged. They now have the power to commit it themselves, causing them to put much more work into it. Doing the actual commit/push also changes their sense of ownership. Instead of handing over a diff to somebody else, they are now part of the project, owning a small part of it.
    * Observation: ownership and publicity drive participation and quality.
